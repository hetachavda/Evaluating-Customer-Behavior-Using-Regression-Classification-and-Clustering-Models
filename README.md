-- Customer demographics by region
SELECT country, state, city, COUNT(customerNumber) AS num_customers,
       AVG(creditLimit) AS avg_credit_limit
FROM classicmodels.customers
GROUP BY country, state, city
ORDER BY num_customers DESC;

-- Top-selling products
SELECT p.productCode, p.productName,
       SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS total_sales
FROM classicmodels.orderdetails od
JOIN classicmodels.products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY p.productCode, p.productName
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Monthly sales trends
SELECT YEAR(orderDate) AS year, MONTH(orderDate) AS month,
       SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS monthly_sales
FROM classicmodels.orders o
