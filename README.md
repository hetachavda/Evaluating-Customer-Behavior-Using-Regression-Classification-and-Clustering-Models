# 🚗 Classic Car Dealership Analytics  

A **data analytics project** leveraging SQL, visualization, and machine learning techniques to analyze **customer behavior, sales trends, and marketing performance** for a classic car dealership.  

This project was developed as part of **Data Analytics Case Study 1 (DAMO-501-3)**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
The project applies data from the **Classic Models database** to answer key business questions such as:  
- Which **customer demographics** drive sales?  
- What are the **top-selling products** and seasonal trends?  
- How effective are **marketing campaigns** and employee contributions?  
- How can predictive models enhance **decision-making** and **marketing strategies**?  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze **customer demographics** and regional credit limits  
- Identify **top-selling products** and sales trends  
- Examine **seasonal and monthly demand patterns**  
- Evaluate **employee performance and workload distribution**  
- Build predictive models (**Regression, Classification, Clustering**) to support strategy

## 📂 Dataset & SQL Queries  

The project uses the **Classic Models dataset** with key tables: `customers`, `orders`, `orderdetails`, `employees`, `offices`, `products`.  

### Example Queries  

```sql
-- Customer demographics by region
SELECT country, state, city, COUNT(customerNumber) AS num_customers,
       AVG(creditLimit) AS avg_credit_limit
FROM classicmodels.customers
GROUP BY country, state, city
ORDER BY num_customers DESC;
````

```sql
-- Top-selling products
SELECT p.productCode, p.productName,
       SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS total_sales
FROM classicmodels.orderdetails od
JOIN classicmodels.products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY p.productCode, p.productName
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

```sql
-- Monthly sales trends
SELECT YEAR(orderDate) AS year, MONTH(orderDate) AS month,
       SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS monthly_sales
FROM classicmodels.orders o
JOIN classicmodels.orderdetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

## 📊 Data Analysis & Insights

### Customer Demographics

* **USA, Germany, France** = most customers
* USA customers had **higher credit limits** → focus on premium campaigns

### Product Sales Trends

* **1992 Ferrari 360 Spider Red** among top revenue drivers
* Recommendation: increase stock & promotions

### Seasonal Order Trends

* **Sales peak in June & December** → plan targeted campaigns

### Marketing Campaigns

* Some employees manage disproportionately high customer loads
* Office locations don’t always align with **high-density markets**

---

## 🤖 Predictive Models

### 1. Regression (Marketing Spend → Sales Growth)

* **R² = 0.78** → strong predictor
* Suggests marketing spend and demographics drive sales trends

### 2. Classification (High-Value Customers)

* Decision Tree model
* **Accuracy = 82%, Precision = 85%, Recall = 78%**
* Identified high-value customers but recall can be improved with ensemble methods

### 3. Clustering (Customer Segmentation)

* **Silhouette Score = 0.62** → well-defined clusters
* Segments:

  * Cluster 1: High spend, infrequent buyers
  * Cluster 2: Medium spend, frequent buyers
  * Cluster 3: Low spend, occasional buyers

---

## ✅ Key Recommendations

* Focus marketing on **USA high-value customers**
* **Stock and promote** top-selling models
* Launch **seasonal campaigns** before June & December
* Provide **training/support** for overburdened employees
* Use **segmentation-driven marketing** for targeted offers

---

## ⚠️ Strengths & Limitations

**Strengths:**

* Multi-model approach: Regression, Classification, Clustering
* Actionable insights on **customer value & seasonal trends**

**Limitations:**

* Regression didn’t include external factors like competitor pricing
* Classification model affected by **imbalanced data**
* Clustering limited to basic features → may oversimplify behavior
